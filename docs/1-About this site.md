Akheritage.site began about 2016. It is authored and maintained by me, Stephen Curham. I put it together when I was employed by Auckland Council as a heritage professional. 

That job involved design review of proposals to alter heritage buildings and my job title was conservation architect. I was moved to prepare the site on my own time, as Auckland Council was struggling to provide information and guidance to building owners, and I felt that it was needed. 

Akheritage.site went live and then was left unchanged until 2023, when I noticed that it was no longer working. Have decided to get it back up, and to give the content a refresh.
